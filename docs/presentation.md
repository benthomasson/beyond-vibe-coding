# Beyond Vibe Coding: Presentation Script

A presentation on getting Claude Code to write code in your style.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Clean title slide with "Beyond Vibe Coding" prominently displayed

**Script:**
"Welcome to Beyond Vibe Coding - a methodology for teaching Claude Code your codebase's unique patterns and personality. Today we'll explore how conversation and examples can help Claude generate code that feels naturally integrated with your existing system."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visual:** Split screen showing messy generated code vs. clean, styled code

**Script:**
"We've all been there - you ask an AI to write some code, and while it works, it doesn't feel like YOUR code. The variable names are generic, the structure doesn't match your patterns, and you spend more time refactoring than if you'd written it yourself."

---

## Slide 3: What is Codebase Personality?
**Visual:** Code examples showing the same functionality implemented in different codebase styles

**Script:**
"Every codebase develops its own personality over time - a unique DNA that reflects the people who have worked there. It's your naming conventions that mirror your domain language, architectural patterns proven in your context, and problem-solving approaches that reflect your team's collective wisdom."

---

## Slide 4: The Documentation Insight
**Visual:** Diagram showing Claude analyzing code, creating documentation, and humans refining it

**Script:**
"The key insight is that Claude excels at pattern recognition and documentation. Rather than having developers write style guides for Claude to follow, let Claude discover patterns from your code examples and document them. This creates persistent knowledge that eliminates the need to re-teach patterns."

---

## Slide 5: Core Principle #1 - Start with Conversation
**Visual:** Split screen showing conversation and resulting code

**Script:**
"First principle: Start with Conversation. Don't just describe what you want - discuss what makes your codebase unique and why. Explain the reasoning behind your patterns, the context that makes them effective, and the problems they solve."

---

## Slide 6: Core Principle #2 - Let Claude Discover
**Visual:** Split screen showing code examples and Claude's pattern analysis

**Script:**
"Second: Let Claude Discover. Provide examples and let Claude analyze them to identify patterns. Claude can often recognize consistent approaches and architectural decisions that you might not have explicitly articulated."

---

## Slide 7: Core Principle #3 - Document Collaboratively
**Visual:** Markdown documentation being created and refined by both Claude and human

**Script:**
"Third: Document Collaboratively. Have Claude create markdown documentation of discovered patterns, then work together to refine it. Add context about why patterns work, domain-specific knowledge, and reasoning that Claude couldn't infer from code alone."

---

## Slide 8: Core Principle #4 - Build Persistent Knowledge
**Visual:** Growing documentation library that persists between sessions

**Script:**
"Fourth: Build Persistent Knowledge. Create lasting documentation that eliminates the need to re-teach patterns in every session. This documentation becomes a shared artifact that both humans and AI can reference and improve over time."

---

## Slide 9: The Workflow - Phase 1: Setup
**Visual:** Checklist of setup items

**Script:**
"Let's walk through the workflow. Phase 1 is Setup. Configure your environment, establish your coding standards, and prepare examples of your best code to use as references."

---

## Slide 10: The Workflow - Phase 2: Pattern Discovery
**Visual:** Claude analyzing code and generating initial pattern documentation

**Script:**
"Phase 2: Pattern Discovery. Share your best code examples and have Claude analyze them to identify patterns. Claude creates initial documentation of what it discovers, capturing consistent approaches and architectural decisions."

---

## Slide 11: The Workflow - Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement
**Visual:** Documentation being reviewed and improved by developers and Claude together

**Script:**
"Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement. Review Claude's documentation and work together to improve it. Add context, reasoning, and domain knowledge. Test the documented patterns in practice and update based on what works."

---

## Slide 12: The Workflow - Phase 4: Knowledge Evolution
**Visual:** Documentation evolving and growing over time with version history

**Script:**
"Phase 4: Knowledge Evolution. The documentation grows and evolves as your codebase changes. Team members can contribute to pattern documentation, and you can apply these documentation techniques to new projects."

---

## Slide 13: Live Demo
**Visual:** Screen recording showing pattern discovery and documentation creation

**Script:**
"Now let's see this in action. I'll show Claude some code examples, have it analyze and document the patterns it discovers, then we'll refine that documentation together and use it to generate new code that follows our established patterns."

---

## Slide 14: Common Pitfalls
**Visual:** Warning signs and anti-patterns

**Script:**
"Let's talk about common pitfalls. Being too vague without examples, focusing only on syntax instead of deeper patterns, and not explaining the reasoning behind your choices are the quickest ways to get code that doesn't match your codebase personality."

---

## Slide 15: Best Practices Summary
**Visual:** Key points highlighted

**Script:**
"To summarize our best practices: Let Claude discover patterns from your code examples, collaborate on documenting those patterns with context and reasoning, build persistent knowledge that eliminates re-teaching, and evolve the documentation as your codebase grows."

---

## Slide 16: The Documentation Advantage
**Visual:** Before/after comparison showing repeated teaching vs. persistent documentation

**Script:**
"The documentation advantage transforms the relationship. Instead of repeatedly teaching the same patterns, you build up a knowledge base that captures Claude's insights and human context. This creates lasting value that benefits the entire team."

---

## Slide 17: Measuring Success
**Visual:** Documentation quality and team adoption metrics

**Script:**
"How do you know it's working? Documentation captures insights you hadn't explicitly articulated. New team members can understand your codebase by reading Claude's pattern analysis. The documentation evolves and improves over time, and generates code that follows established patterns without repeated teaching."

---

## Slide 18: Next Steps
**Visual:** Action items and resources

**Script:**
"Ready to get started? Identify what makes your codebase unique, collect examples of your best code that demonstrate these patterns, and start having conversations with Claude about the reasoning behind your choices. Begin with small tasks to test understanding."

---

## Slide 19: Q&A
**Visual:** Contact information and resources

**Script:**
"That's our Beyond Vibe Coding approach. Let's open it up for questions. How can you apply these principles to your specific development workflow?"

---

## Slide 20: Thank You
**Visual:** Clean thank you slide with resources

**Script:**
"Thank you for your attention. Remember, the goal is to create a collaborative knowledge-building system where Claude's pattern recognition insights are captured in documentation that both humans and AI can reference and improve. This transforms occasional teaching into persistent knowledge that grows with your team."
