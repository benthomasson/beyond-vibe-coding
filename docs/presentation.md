# Beyond Vibe Coding: Presentation Script

A presentation on getting Claude Code to write code in your style.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Clean title slide with "Beyond Vibe Coding" prominently displayed

**Script:**
"Welcome to Beyond Vibe Coding - a guide to getting AI to write the code you would have written anyway. Today we'll explore how to work with Claude Code to generate code that truly matches your personal style and coding preferences."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visual:** Split screen showing messy generated code vs. clean, styled code

**Script:**
"We've all been there - you ask an AI to write some code, and while it works, it doesn't feel like YOUR code. The variable names are generic, the structure doesn't match your patterns, and you spend more time refactoring than if you'd written it yourself."

---

## Slide 3: What is "Your Style"?
**Visual:** Code examples showing different coding styles side by side

**Script:**
"But what exactly is 'your style'? It's more than just formatting. It's your naming conventions, your architectural patterns, your error handling approach, your testing philosophy. It's the accumulated wisdom of your experience encoded in how you structure and write code."

---

## Slide 4: The Beyond Vibe Approach
**Visual:** Diagram showing the iterative feedback loop

**Script:**
"The Beyond Vibe approach is about creating a collaborative relationship with Claude Code where you guide it to understand not just what you want to build, but how you want to build it."

---

## Slide 5: Core Principle #1 - Establish Context
**Visual:** Before/after code examples showing context improvement

**Script:**
"First principle: Establish Context. Don't just describe what you want - show Claude Code your existing codebase. Share patterns, architectural decisions, and the reasoning behind your choices."

---

## Slide 6: Core Principle #2 - Define Your Style
**Visual:** Style guide examples and coding standards

**Script:**
"Second: Define Your Style explicitly. Create style guides, share your linting rules, and explain your preferences. The more specific you are, the better Claude Code can match your approach."

---

## Slide 7: Core Principle #3 - Provide Examples
**Visual:** Code examples showing good patterns

**Script:**
"Third: Provide Examples. Show don't just tell. When you have existing code that represents your style well, share it as a reference for new code generation."

---

## Slide 8: Core Principle #4 - Iterative Refinement
**Visual:** Feedback loop diagram

**Script:**
"Fourth: Iterative Refinement. Don't expect perfection on the first try. Review the generated code, provide feedback, and guide Claude Code toward your preferred approach."

---

## Slide 9: The Workflow - Phase 1: Setup
**Visual:** Checklist of setup items

**Script:**
"Let's walk through the workflow. Phase 1 is Setup. Configure your environment, establish your coding standards, and prepare examples of your best code to use as references."

---

## Slide 10: The Workflow - Phase 2: Context Building
**Visual:** Codebase exploration visualization

**Script:**
"Phase 2: Context Building. This is where you help Claude Code understand your codebase. Share relevant patterns, explain architectural decisions, and provide your style guidelines."

---

## Slide 11: The Workflow - Phase 3: Collaborative Coding
**Visual:** Split screen showing human and AI collaboration

**Script:**
"Phase 3: Collaborative Coding. Start with small tasks, review and refine the outputs, and gradually build up a pattern library that Claude Code can reference for future work."

---

## Slide 12: The Workflow - Phase 4: Optimization
**Visual:** Performance metrics and streamlined processes

**Script:**
"Phase 4: Optimization. Once you've established good patterns, streamline common workflows, create reusable templates, and document the lessons you've learned for future reference."

---

## Slide 13: Live Demo
**Visual:** Screen recording or live coding session

**Script:**
"Now let's see this in action. I'll demonstrate how to guide Claude Code through generating a component that matches a specific coding style, showing the iterative refinement process in real-time."

---

## Slide 14: Common Pitfalls
**Visual:** Warning signs and anti-patterns

**Script:**
"Let's talk about common pitfalls. Being too vague in your requests, not providing enough context, and accepting the first output without refinement are the quickest ways to get code that doesn't match your style."

---

## Slide 15: Best Practices Summary
**Visual:** Key points highlighted

**Script:**
"To summarize our best practices: Be specific about your requirements, provide rich context, use examples liberally, iterate on outputs, and build up a knowledge base of successful patterns."

---

## Slide 16: Tools and Features
**Visual:** Screenshot of Claude Code features

**Script:**
"Claude Code provides several features that support this workflow: memory management for context persistence, file reading capabilities for understanding your codebase, and iterative editing tools for refinement."

---

## Slide 17: Measuring Success
**Visual:** Before/after code quality metrics

**Script:**
"How do you know it's working? You'll spend less time refactoring generated code, the output will feel more familiar and maintainable, and you'll find yourself building on the generated code rather than rewriting it."

---

## Slide 18: Next Steps
**Visual:** Action items and resources

**Script:**
"Ready to get started? Begin by documenting your current coding style, identify your most common patterns, and start with small experiments to build up your collaborative relationship with Claude Code."

---

## Slide 19: Q&A
**Visual:** Contact information and resources

**Script:**
"That's our Beyond Vibe Coding approach. Let's open it up for questions. How can you apply these principles to your specific development workflow?"

---

## Slide 20: Thank You
**Visual:** Clean thank you slide with resources

**Script:**
"Thank you for your attention. Remember, the goal isn't to replace your coding skills, but to amplify them. When done right, AI becomes an extension of your development process, writing code that truly feels like yours."
