# Beyond Vibe Coding: Presentation Script

A presentation on getting Claude Code to write code in your style.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Clean title slide with "Beyond Vibe Coding" prominently displayed

**Script:**
"Welcome to Beyond Vibe Coding - a methodology for teaching Claude Code your codebase's unique patterns and personality. Today we'll explore how conversation and examples can help Claude generate code that feels naturally integrated with your existing system."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visual:** Split screen showing messy generated code vs. clean, styled code

**Script:**
"We've all been there - you ask an AI to write some code, and while it works, it doesn't feel like YOUR code. The variable names are generic, the structure doesn't match your patterns, and you spend more time refactoring than if you'd written it yourself."

---

## Slide 3: What is Codebase Personality?
**Visual:** Code examples showing the same functionality implemented in different codebase styles

**Script:**
"Every codebase develops its own personality over time - a unique DNA that reflects the people who have worked there. It's your naming conventions that mirror your domain language, architectural patterns proven in your context, and problem-solving approaches that reflect your team's collective wisdom."

---

## Slide 4: The Pattern Recognition Insight
**Visual:** Diagram showing Claude learning from examples and applying patterns

**Script:**
"The key insight is that Claude excels at pattern recognition and extrapolation. When you show it examples of your best code and explain the reasoning behind your choices, Claude can internalize those patterns and apply them consistently to new situations."

---

## Slide 5: Core Principle #1 - Start with Conversation
**Visual:** Split screen showing conversation and resulting code

**Script:**
"First principle: Start with Conversation. Don't just describe what you want - discuss what makes your codebase unique and why. Explain the reasoning behind your patterns, the context that makes them effective, and the problems they solve."

---

## Slide 6: Core Principle #2 - Show Through Examples
**Visual:** Examples of excellent code with annotations highlighting patterns

**Script:**
"Second: Show Through Examples. Provide concrete examples of your best code that demonstrate your patterns in action. Claude learns better from seeing how you've solved real problems than from abstract descriptions."

---

## Slide 7: Core Principle #3 - Focus on the Why
**Visual:** Code example with callouts explaining the reasoning behind design choices

**Script:**
"Third: Focus on the Why. Don't just show your patterns - explain the context that makes them effective. Help Claude understand why certain approaches work in your environment so it can make similar decisions in new scenarios."

---

## Slide 8: Core Principle #4 - Trust Pattern Recognition
**Visual:** Animation showing Claude applying learned patterns to new scenarios

**Script:**
"Fourth: Trust Pattern Recognition. Once you've shared examples and context, let Claude apply what it's learned. Its strength lies in recognizing patterns and applying them consistently, often in ways that feel naturally integrated with your existing code."

---

## Slide 9: The Workflow - Phase 1: Setup
**Visual:** Checklist of setup items

**Script:**
"Let's walk through the workflow. Phase 1 is Setup. Configure your environment, establish your coding standards, and prepare examples of your best code to use as references."

---

## Slide 10: The Workflow - Phase 2: Pattern Teaching
**Visual:** Conversation interface showing pattern explanation and examples

**Script:**
"Phase 2: Pattern Teaching. This is where you have the conversation with Claude about what makes your codebase unique. Share examples, explain reasoning, and demonstrate how different patterns work together in your system."

---

## Slide 11: The Workflow - Phase 3: Collaborative Coding
**Visual:** Progressive examples showing Claude applying learned patterns to increasingly complex tasks

**Script:**
"Phase 3: Collaborative Coding. Give Claude small tasks that exercise your key patterns. Let it apply what it's learned to new situations, providing feedback when outputs don't match your style. Build confidence through successful iterations."

---

## Slide 12: The Workflow - Phase 4: Optimization
**Visual:** Performance metrics and streamlined processes

**Script:**
"Phase 4: Optimization. Once you've established good patterns, streamline common workflows, create reusable templates, and document the lessons you've learned for future reference."

---

## Slide 13: Live Demo
**Visual:** Screen recording or live coding session

**Script:**
"Now let's see this in action. I'll demonstrate how to teach Claude about a codebase's unique patterns through conversation and examples, then watch as it applies those patterns to generate code that feels naturally integrated."

---

## Slide 14: Common Pitfalls
**Visual:** Warning signs and anti-patterns

**Script:**
"Let's talk about common pitfalls. Being too vague without examples, focusing only on syntax instead of deeper patterns, and not explaining the reasoning behind your choices are the quickest ways to get code that doesn't match your codebase personality."

---

## Slide 15: Best Practices Summary
**Visual:** Key points highlighted

**Script:**
"To summarize our best practices: Start with conversation to explain context and reasoning, share your best code as examples, help Claude understand why your patterns work, and trust its pattern recognition abilities to apply learning to new situations."

---

## Slide 16: Tools and Features
**Visual:** Screenshot of Claude Code features

**Script:**
"Claude Code provides several features that support this workflow: memory management for context persistence, file reading capabilities for understanding your codebase, and iterative editing tools for refinement."

---

## Slide 17: Measuring Success
**Visual:** Before/after code quality metrics

**Script:**
"How do you know it's working? Generated code feels familiar and fits naturally into your codebase. Claude anticipates your architectural preferences. You spend less time refactoring and more time building on the generated code. New team members can use Claude to learn your patterns."

---

## Slide 18: Next Steps
**Visual:** Action items and resources

**Script:**
"Ready to get started? Identify what makes your codebase unique, collect examples of your best code that demonstrate these patterns, and start having conversations with Claude about the reasoning behind your choices. Begin with small tasks to test understanding."

---

## Slide 19: Q&A
**Visual:** Contact information and resources

**Script:**
"That's our Beyond Vibe Coding approach. Let's open it up for questions. How can you apply these principles to your specific development workflow?"

---

## Slide 20: Thank You
**Visual:** Clean thank you slide with resources

**Script:**
"Thank you for your attention. Remember, Claude's strength lies in pattern recognition and extrapolation. When you teach it your codebase's unique personality through conversation and examples, it becomes an extension of your development process, understanding your system so well that generated code feels like a natural part of it."
