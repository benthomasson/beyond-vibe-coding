# Beyond Vibe Coding: Presentation Script

A presentation on getting Claude Code to write code in your style.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Clean title slide with "Beyond Vibe Coding" prominently displayed

**Script:**
"Welcome to Beyond Vibe Coding - a methodology for discovering, documenting, and applying the unique patterns of any codebase. Today we'll explore how Claude can become a 'code archaeologist' that unlocks the hidden wisdom in any codebase, whether you wrote it or not."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visual:** Split screen showing generic AI code vs. context-aware code

**Script:**
"We've all been there - you ask an AI to write code, and while it works, it doesn't fit the codebase. This problem is even more acute when working with legacy systems, open source projects, or any code you didn't write. There's far more code out there that we didn't write than we did write."

---

## Slide 3: Code as Hidden Knowledge
**Visual:** Iceberg diagram showing visible code vs. hidden patterns and reasoning

**Script:**
"Every codebase contains hidden knowledge - implicit patterns, architectural decisions, and problem-solving approaches that aren't documented anywhere. Whether it's your team's code, a legacy system, or an open source project, there's valuable wisdom embedded in the code itself waiting to be discovered."

---

## Slide 4: Claude as Code Archaeologist
**Visual:** Diagram showing Claude analyzing various codebases and extracting patterns

**Script:**
"The key insight is that Claude can serve as a 'code archaeologist' - examining any codebase and discovering the implicit patterns and reasoning embedded within. Whether analyzing your own code, legacy systems, or open source projects, Claude can extract and document the architectural wisdom that would otherwise remain hidden."

---

## Slide 5: Core Principle #1 - Start with Conversation
**Visual:** Split screen showing conversation and resulting code

**Script:**
"First principle: Start with Conversation. Don't just describe what you want - discuss what makes your codebase unique and why. Explain the reasoning behind your patterns, the context that makes them effective, and the problems they solve."

---

## Slide 6: Core Principle #2 - Let Claude Discover
**Visual:** Split screen showing code examples and Claude's pattern analysis

**Script:**
"Second: Let Claude Discover. Provide examples and let Claude analyze them to identify patterns. Claude can often recognize consistent approaches and architectural decisions that you might not have explicitly articulated."

---

## Slide 7: Core Principle #3 - Document Collaboratively
**Visual:** Markdown documentation being created and refined by both Claude and human

**Script:**
"Third: Document Collaboratively. Have Claude create markdown documentation of discovered patterns, then work together to refine it. Add context about why patterns work, domain-specific knowledge, and reasoning that Claude couldn't infer from code alone."

---

## Slide 8: Core Principle #4 - Build Persistent Knowledge
**Visual:** Growing documentation library that persists between sessions

**Script:**
"Fourth: Build Persistent Knowledge. Create lasting documentation that eliminates the need to re-teach patterns in every session. This documentation becomes a shared artifact that both humans and AI can reference and improve over time."

---

## Slide 9: The Workflow - Phase 1: Target Selection
**Visual:** Different types of codebases (legacy, open source, third-party)

**Script:**
"Let's walk through the workflow. Phase 1 is Target Selection. Choose any codebase you want to understand - your own team's code, a legacy system you inherited, an open source project you want to learn from, or third-party code you need to integrate with."

---

## Slide 10: The Workflow - Phase 2: Archaeological Analysis
**Visual:** Claude examining unfamiliar code and identifying patterns

**Script:**
"Phase 2: Archaeological Analysis. Provide representative code samples from any codebase and have Claude examine them for patterns. Claude becomes a detective, identifying consistent approaches, naming conventions, and architectural decisions even in code you've never seen before."

---

## Slide 11: The Workflow - Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement
**Visual:** Documentation being reviewed and improved by developers and Claude together

**Script:**
"Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement. Review Claude's documentation and work together to improve it. Add context, reasoning, and domain knowledge. Test the documented patterns in practice and update based on what works."

---

## Slide 12: The Workflow - Phase 4: Future-Proofing
**Visual:** Documentation supporting future developers and AI instances seamlessly

**Script:**
"Phase 4: Future-Proofing. The documentation becomes a bridge to the future. New developers can understand patterns immediately, different AI instances can pick up where others left off, and your codebase maintains consistency even as teams change. You're building institutional memory that lasts."

---

## Slide 13: Live Demo
**Visual:** Screen recording showing analysis of unfamiliar legacy code

**Script:**
"Now let's see this in action. I'll show Claude a legacy codebase none of us wrote, watch it discover the implicit patterns and architectural decisions, then see how we can use that understanding to generate new code that fits seamlessly with the existing system."

---

## Slide 14: Common Pitfalls
**Visual:** Warning signs and anti-patterns

**Script:**
"Let's talk about common pitfalls. Creating documentation that only serves today's team, focusing on surface patterns without deeper reasoning, and not planning for knowledge transfer are the quickest ways to lose institutional memory when team composition changes."

---

## Slide 15: Best Practices Summary
**Visual:** Key points highlighted

**Script:**
"To summarize our best practices: Let Claude discover patterns from your code examples, collaborate on documenting with future maintainers in mind, build institutional memory that survives team changes, and create documentation that serves as a bridge between past architectural decisions and future development needs."

---

## Slide 16: Universal Code Comprehension
**Visual:** World map showing different codebases being analyzed and understood

**Script:**
"The real power lies in universal code comprehension. This approach works on any codebase where source is available. Legacy systems, open source projects, third-party libraries - Claude can analyze and document patterns in code you've never seen, making the collective wisdom of the software development community more accessible."

---

## Slide 17: Beyond Your Own Code
**Visual:** Examples of legacy system analysis, open source learning, and third-party integration

**Script:**
"The transformative aspect is going beyond your own code. Analyze legacy systems to understand their architectural intent. Learn from successful open source projects' proven patterns. Discover how external libraries expect to be used. Extract wisdom from any codebase you encounter."

---

## Slide 18: Unlock Hidden Knowledge
**Visual:** Before/after showing opaque legacy code becoming comprehensible

**Script:**
"Ready to unlock hidden knowledge? Start with any codebase you want to understand better. Let Claude analyze patterns in legacy systems before they become unmaintainable. Learn from open source masters by documenting their approaches. Make the implicit wisdom in any codebase explicit and actionable."

---

## Slide 19: Q&A
**Visual:** Contact information and resources

**Script:**
"That's our Beyond Vibe Coding approach - a knowledge preservation system that ensures your codebase's unique personality survives and thrives regardless of team changes. Let's open it up for questions about building documentation that serves both current and future development needs."

---

## Slide 20: Thank You
**Visual:** Clean thank you slide with resources

**Script:**
"Thank you for your attention. Remember, Beyond Vibe Coding acknowledges a fundamental truth: there's far more code we didn't write than we did write. By turning Claude into a code archaeologist, we can unlock the architectural wisdom embedded in any codebase, making the collective knowledge of the software development community more accessible and actionable for everyone."
