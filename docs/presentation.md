# Beyond Vibe Coding: Presentation Script

A presentation on getting Claude Code to write code in your style.

## Slide 1: Title Slide
**Visual:** Clean title slide with "Beyond Vibe Coding" prominently displayed

**Script:**
"Welcome to Beyond Vibe Coding - a methodology for teaching Claude Code your codebase's unique patterns and personality. Today we'll explore how conversation and examples can help Claude generate code that feels naturally integrated with your existing system."

---

## Slide 2: The Problem
**Visual:** Split screen showing messy generated code vs. clean, styled code

**Script:**
"We've all been there - you ask an AI to write some code, and while it works, it doesn't feel like YOUR code. The variable names are generic, the structure doesn't match your patterns, and you spend more time refactoring than if you'd written it yourself."

---

## Slide 3: What is Codebase Personality?
**Visual:** Code examples showing the same functionality implemented in different codebase styles

**Script:**
"Every codebase develops its own personality over time - a unique DNA that reflects the people who have worked there. It's your naming conventions that mirror your domain language, architectural patterns proven in your context, and problem-solving approaches that reflect your team's collective wisdom."

---

## Slide 4: The Documentation Insight
**Visual:** Diagram showing Claude analyzing code, creating documentation, and humans refining it

**Script:**
"The key insight is that Claude excels at pattern recognition and documentation. Rather than having developers write style guides for Claude to follow, let Claude discover patterns from your code examples and document them. This creates persistent knowledge that eliminates the need to re-teach patterns."

---

## Slide 5: Core Principle #1 - Start with Conversation
**Visual:** Split screen showing conversation and resulting code

**Script:**
"First principle: Start with Conversation. Don't just describe what you want - discuss what makes your codebase unique and why. Explain the reasoning behind your patterns, the context that makes them effective, and the problems they solve."

---

## Slide 6: Core Principle #2 - Let Claude Discover
**Visual:** Split screen showing code examples and Claude's pattern analysis

**Script:**
"Second: Let Claude Discover. Provide examples and let Claude analyze them to identify patterns. Claude can often recognize consistent approaches and architectural decisions that you might not have explicitly articulated."

---

## Slide 7: Core Principle #3 - Document Collaboratively
**Visual:** Markdown documentation being created and refined by both Claude and human

**Script:**
"Third: Document Collaboratively. Have Claude create markdown documentation of discovered patterns, then work together to refine it. Add context about why patterns work, domain-specific knowledge, and reasoning that Claude couldn't infer from code alone."

---

## Slide 8: Core Principle #4 - Build Persistent Knowledge
**Visual:** Growing documentation library that persists between sessions

**Script:**
"Fourth: Build Persistent Knowledge. Create lasting documentation that eliminates the need to re-teach patterns in every session. This documentation becomes a shared artifact that both humans and AI can reference and improve over time."

---

## Slide 9: The Workflow - Phase 1: Setup
**Visual:** Checklist of setup items

**Script:**
"Let's walk through the workflow. Phase 1 is Setup. Configure your environment, establish your coding standards, and prepare examples of your best code to use as references."

---

## Slide 10: The Workflow - Phase 2: Pattern Discovery
**Visual:** Claude analyzing code and generating initial pattern documentation

**Script:**
"Phase 2: Pattern Discovery. Share your best code examples and have Claude analyze them to identify patterns. Claude creates initial documentation of what it discovers, capturing consistent approaches and architectural decisions."

---

## Slide 11: The Workflow - Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement
**Visual:** Documentation being reviewed and improved by developers and Claude together

**Script:**
"Phase 3: Collaborative Refinement. Review Claude's documentation and work together to improve it. Add context, reasoning, and domain knowledge. Test the documented patterns in practice and update based on what works."

---

## Slide 12: The Workflow - Phase 4: Future-Proofing
**Visual:** Documentation supporting future developers and AI instances seamlessly

**Script:**
"Phase 4: Future-Proofing. The documentation becomes a bridge to the future. New developers can understand patterns immediately, different AI instances can pick up where others left off, and your codebase maintains consistency even as teams change. You're building institutional memory that lasts."

---

## Slide 13: Live Demo
**Visual:** Screen recording showing pattern discovery and documentation creation

**Script:**
"Now let's see this in action. I'll show Claude some code examples, have it analyze and document the patterns it discovers, then we'll refine that documentation together and use it to generate new code that follows our established patterns."

---

## Slide 14: Common Pitfalls
**Visual:** Warning signs and anti-patterns

**Script:**
"Let's talk about common pitfalls. Creating documentation that only serves today's team, focusing on surface patterns without deeper reasoning, and not planning for knowledge transfer are the quickest ways to lose institutional memory when team composition changes."

---

## Slide 15: Best Practices Summary
**Visual:** Key points highlighted

**Script:**
"To summarize our best practices: Let Claude discover patterns from your code examples, collaborate on documenting with future maintainers in mind, build institutional memory that survives team changes, and create documentation that serves as a bridge between past architectural decisions and future development needs."

---

## Slide 16: Knowledge Preservation Value
**Visual:** Timeline showing team changes with consistent codebase patterns maintained through documentation

**Script:**
"The real power lies in knowledge preservation. This documentation becomes institutional memory that survives team changes. New developers can understand your codebase immediately, and future AI instances can pick up where previous sessions left off, ensuring consistency across years of development."

---

## Slide 17: Long-term Impact
**Visual:** Codebase timeline showing consistency maintained through team transitions

**Script:**
"The long-term impact is transformative. Your codebase maintains its personality even as original developers leave. New maintainers understand both what the code does and why it was structured that way. Future AI tools can validate consistency and suggest improvements while respecting established architectural decisions."

---

## Slide 18: Building for the Future
**Visual:** Roadmap showing immediate benefits leading to long-term value

**Script:**
"Ready to build for the future? Start by documenting your current patterns with Claude's help, but think beyond today's team. Create documentation that will serve future developers and AI instances. This isn't just about better code generation now - it's about preserving your team's collective wisdom for years to come."

---

## Slide 19: Q&A
**Visual:** Contact information and resources

**Script:**
"That's our Beyond Vibe Coding approach - a knowledge preservation system that ensures your codebase's unique personality survives and thrives regardless of team changes. Let's open it up for questions about building documentation that serves both current and future development needs."

---

## Slide 20: Thank You
**Visual:** Clean thank you slide with resources

**Script:**
"Thank you for your attention. Remember, Beyond Vibe Coding is more than a development methodology - it's an investment in your codebase's future. By documenting Claude's pattern insights alongside human reasoning, you create institutional memory that ensures your hard-learned patterns and architectural wisdom continue to guide development long after today's team has moved on."
